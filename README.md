## Cut-Pursuit with Preconditioned Forward-Douglasâ€“Rachford for Minimizing Graph Total Variation with Additional Nondifferentiable Terms

This repository is rendered obsolete by new C++ implementations, hierarchically organized in classes, optimized for speed and memory, fixing some bugs, and computing the splitting steps of cut-pursuit *in parallel along the components*.
